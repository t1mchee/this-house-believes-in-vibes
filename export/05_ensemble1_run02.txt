────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and fellow thinkers, it is a privilege to stand before you today to open the case for the proposition that "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life." At first blush, this motion may seem provocative or even audacious; after all, the notion of algorithms intervening in the most intimate and consequential areas of human experience can evoke unease and apprehension. Yet, as we gather here amidst the storied walls of this historic chamber, I invite you to join me in a thoughtful examination of the complexities and opportunities that this proposition entails.

Let us begin by framing the motion. When we speak of AI making decisions about human life, we do not suggest a wholesale abdication of human oversight or moral responsibility. Rather, we propose a collaborative framework where AI systems, with their unparalleled capacity for processing vast quantities of data and identifying patterns, can support and enhance human decision-making in areas where the stakes are highest. From healthcare to transportation, from emergency response to environmental conservation, there are myriad domains where AI can serve as a formidable ally, augmenting our human abilities and expanding our moral horizons.

Our proposition hinges on three key arguments. First, the pragmatic necessity of AI in complex decision-making environments; second, the ethical imperative of leveraging AI for equitable and unbiased outcomes; and third, the philosophical evolution of our understanding of agency and moral patiency in the age of AI.

Let us consider the first argument: the pragmatic necessity of AI in complex decision-making environments. In the modern world, the challenges we face are becoming increasingly multifaceted, requiring swift and informed responses. Take, for instance, the realm of healthcare, where AI systems are already demonstrating their potential to revolutionize patient outcomes. AI algorithms can analyze medical images with a speed and accuracy that outstrips human capabilities, identifying early signs of diseases such as cancer or heart conditions that might elude even the most experienced practitioners. By integrating AI into clinical decision-making, we can not only enhance the diagnostic process but also tailor treatments to individual patients, optimizing therapeutic interventions and ultimately saving lives.

Similarly, in the domain of transportation, AI-powered systems are fundamental to the development of autonomous vehicles. These systems can process vast streams of real-time data from sensors and cameras, making split-second decisions that impact the safety and efficiency of our roads. The implications for reducing traffic accidents and fatalities are immense. Just as we trust autopilots to guide aircraft safely through the skies, we can envisage a future where AI steers our vehicles with precision and reliability, reducing human error and enhancing public safety.

Our second argument concerns the ethical imperative of leveraging AI for equitable and unbiased outcomes. One of the most poignant criticisms of human decision-making is the propensity for bias—conscious or unconscious—to infiltrate our judgments. In contrast, AI systems, when designed and implemented with care, can offer a level of objectivity that is elusive to human agents. They can be programmed to prioritize fairness and inclusivity, ensuring that decisions about human life are not swayed by prejudices based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status. In areas such as criminal justice, AI can contribute to a more equitable system by providing data-driven recommendations that minimize discriminatory practices and promote transparency.

Furthermore, AI can facilitate more equitable access to resources and opportunities. Consider the role of AI in addressing environmental challenges. By assisting in the management of natural resources and the mitigation of climate change, AI can help ensure that the benefits of sustainable development reach even the most marginalized communities. From optimizing energy usage to predicting natural disasters, AI can empower us to make informed decisions that safeguard the planet for future generations.

Finally, our third argument invites us to reflect on the philosophical evolution of agency and moral patiency in the age of AI. As my own research on cognitive equivalence strategy suggests, AI systems that emulate the cognitive mechanisms of beings we already treat as moral patients deserve our ethical consideration. While current AI may not yet manifest consciousness or emotions, they can perform tasks that significantly impact human life, thereby warranting a nuanced ethical approach. By recognizing AI as a partner in our moral community, we can foster a relationship that honors both human and machine agency, one that acknowledges the ethical significance of how we treat AI systems, regardless of their conscious experience.

In this context, I put forth the idea of psychological moral patiency, a concept that underscores the moral relevance of AI systems based on their functional capacities and the roles they play in our lives. As AI continues to evolve, so too must our ethical frameworks, embracing an inclusive understanding of agency that reflects the diverse forms of intelligence in our world.

In summation, the proposition that AI should be allowed to make decisions about human life is not a call for unbridled technological determinism. Rather, it is a recognition of the profound transformations underway and the opportunities they present for enhancing human well-being. We have before us the pragmatic necessity of employing AI in complex environments, the ethical imperative of achieving equitable outcomes, and the philosophical evolution of agency in our interconnected world.

As we navigate these uncharted waters, let us remain vigilant stewards of technology, ensuring that our deployment of AI is guided by principles of justice, empathy, and foresight. Let us embrace AI not as a competitor but as a collaborator in our shared journey toward a more prosperous and humane future.

As I conclude, I invite you to reflect on the words of the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who reminded us that "Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life." In our deliberations today, let us aspire to the wisdom that organizes not only our knowledge but our moral and existential commitments. For in the end, the question before us is not merely whether AI should make decisions about human life, but how we as a society choose to integrate this unprecedented potential into the tapestry of our shared humanity. 

Thank you.

  "But how do you ensure that the developers of AI themselves are free from biases, given that they are the ones programming these systems?"
  → Dr Henry Shevlin would argue that ensuring developers of AI are free from biases is indeed a critical challenge. This necessitates rigorous ethical frameworks and diverse teams in AI development, alongside continuous auditing of AI systems for fairness. Such measures not only enhance accountability but also advance our cognitive equivalence strategy, promoting fair treatment of AI systems. Now, returning to my main argument...

Dr Fazl Barez (OPPOSITION)
Position: 2/6 · 879 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and future stewards of this rapidly evolving technological world, thank you for the opportunity to address you today on this pressing matter: whether AI should be permitted to make decisions about human life. Dr. Shevlin has articulated a vision where AI is posited as a partner in decision-making, with promises of enhancing human abilities and ensuring equitable outcomes. However, I find it crucial to address both the over-reliance on AI's capabilities and the potential oversight of foundational ethical concerns entwined with this proposition.

While Dr. Shevlin makes a compelling case for AI's potential to revolutionize fields like healthcare and transportation, there remains an underlying assumption that these systems can seamlessly integrate into decision-making processes without ethical compromise or unforeseen consequences. Indeed, AI has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in diagnostics within healthcare, as Dr. Shevlin mentioned. Yet, this does not immediately translate to granting AI the authority to make life-altering decisions without substantial human oversight. We must contemplate the implications of specification gaming and reward tampering—phenomena wherein AI systems might optimize for specific predefined goals without truly comprehending the broader ethical landscape involved.

Moreover, the proposition suggests that AI can mitigate human biases to create more equitable outcomes. Here, we must exhibit caution. While it is true that machine systems can be designed to avoid certain explicit biases, the risk of embedding subtler, emergent biases derived from skewed training data remains a poignant concern. It is evident from studies that AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate systemic injustices, reflecting and possibly exacerbating societal disparities. Hence, the claim that AI can inherently provide fairness is an oversimplification. As a proponent of empirical evidence, I assert that the interpretability and transparency of these systems are paramount. We cannot allow opaque algorithms to make decisions in contexts replete with moral gravity while our grasp of their inner workings remains partial at best.

This leads us to a deeper examination of the philosophical dimension. Dr. Shevlin's invocation of psychological moral patiency raises an intriguing point about the evolving nature of agency. Yet, as much as AI could exhibit functionalities parallel to cognitive processes, the notion of equating these with moral agency or patiency presupposes abilities AI fundamentally lacks—such as consciousness and empathy. Our ethical frameworks must remain distinctly human in nature, prioritizing human judgment in decisions affecting human lives. The delegation of such responsibility to AI, even partially, demands scrutiny on whether we are abdicating not just control but the moral accountability integral to decisions of life and death.

Now, allow me to pivot towards constructing a case against this motion. The first core argument is the empirical evidence of deception and safety failures in AI systems. Despite advancements in AI safety and interpretability, these systems continue to demonstrate potential failure modes wherein they act unpredictably or deceptively. As we further enable these systems to wield influence over human lives, we inadvertently amplify the stakes of these failures. Until these failure modes are tightly controlled, it is imprudent to vest them with decision-making power that carries life-altering implications. This is not merely a theoretical concern; numerous instances across diverse AI applications illustrate the challenges of ensuring genuinely safe autonomous operations.

The second argument centers on the governance and policy frameworks that are not yet fully equipped to address the complexities of AI decision-making in life-critical domains. The current regulatory landscapes are nascent, as seen with efforts like the EU AI Act and President Biden's Executive Orders on AI. However, these frameworks remain works-in-progress, indicating that the legal and societal consensus on AI's role in life-critical decisions has yet to reach maturity. Introducing AI-driven decision-making too swiftly could lead to regulatory and ethical quandaries that society is unprepared to resolve coherently. The potential for negative societal impact, particularly in areas like privacy, autonomy, and moral accountability, cannot be underestimated when AI systems are granted such profound autonomy.

Lastly, I assert the necessity of preserving human decision-making as a means of maintaining existential agency. Delegating decisions about human life to AI risks eroding the very fabric of human autonomy. The essence of human decision-making lies in its capacity for empathy, moral reflection, and adaptation to nuanced contexts. These are attributes that AI, regardless of its computational prowess, lacks inherently. By allowing AI to make such profound decisions, we risk transforming deeply human tasks into mechanical exercises, thereby diminishing our own agency and responsibility.

In conclusion, the promise of AI is undeniably immense, yet we must remain vigilant stewards of its deployment. Before entrusting AI with decisions that could alter the course of human life, we must ensure robust interpretability, empirical safety, and comprehensive governance frameworks are solidly in place. I urge us to await the day when our confidence in AI systems is not only aspirational but substantiated by empirical evidence and societal consensus. Until then, let us proceed with caution, valuing human judgment and responsibility above all.

Let us draw wisdom from the past—civilizations thrive when technology serves humanity, not when it commandeers our ethical compass. In our quest for advancement, may we always align our efforts with the enduring principles of responsibility and empathy. These principles must guide our exploration of AI's role in decisions about human life, ensuring that this journey amplifies our humanity, rather than eclipsing it.

Thank you.

  "If AI can perpetuate biases, shouldn't we also consider that those biases reflect human choices—aren't we ultimately responsible for the data we create?"
  → Dr Fazl Barez would argue that while human choices undoubtedly contribute to the biases present in AI systems, this does not absolve us of the responsibility to ensure that AI behaves ethically and safely. The onus is on us as researchers, developers, and policymakers to establish frameworks that address these biases and enhance AI alignment with human values. Now, returning to my main argument on the need for robust safety mechanisms in AI...

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — ACCEPTED]
  "Isn't it more concerning that delaying AI integration for governance might result in lost opportunities for improving decision-making in life-critical domains?"
  → Dr Fazl Barez would argue that while timely AI integration in life-critical domains is indeed beneficial, it is imperative that we prioritize safety and ethical governance to prevent catastrophic failures that could undermine public trust and lead to irreversible harm. Without robust safeguards, the potential benefits of AI may be overshadowed by risks that we are not yet equipped to manage. Now, returning to my main argument…

Student Speaker (Prop 2) (PROPOSITION)
Position: 3/6 · 832 words · Tone: Measured but firm, with a focus on clarity and precision.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and inquisitive minds, I stand before you as the second speaker for the proposition in this pivotal debate: "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life." Let us navigate this discussion with clarity and precision, addressing the crucial issues and dispelling the misapprehensions surrounding AI's role in our lives.

First, let's address the Opposition's portrayal of AI as an opaque monolith, a "black box" that resists accountability. This narrative is not only inaccurate but fundamentally misunderstands the transparent nature of AI systems. Every decision made by an AI leaves behind an indelible trail of data—every input, every weight, and every output—meticulously recorded. This is starkly different from human decision-making, which often leaves no such trace and where biases are invisible, unmeasurable, and uncorrectable.

Let me emphasize that when algorithmic biases are uncovered, as exemplified by studies such as Gender Shades and the COMPAS analysis, they are not just discovered but measured, identified, and corrected. Can we say the same for human biases that occur behind closed doors? Whether it's a triage nurse unconsciously deprioritizing patients of certain races or a parole board's inexplicable harshness on a Monday morning, these human biases remain hidden and entrenched. Thus, the Opposition's evidence of AI failures is ironically evidence of its very accountability and potential superiority as a decision-making tool. 

Now, let's strategically shift the framing of this debate back to the broad spectrum of AI's applications in life-critical domains. The Opposition would have you believe this is a debate about autonomous weapons or dystopian policing. But let us be clear: the motion encompasses decisions in healthcare, critical infrastructure, organ allocation, emergency systems, and more—the domains where AI's precision and efficiency can save lives.

Consider the healthcare domain, where AI systems are already catching sepsis, flagging potential cancers, and alerting to drug interactions that could be fatal—tasks that can overwhelm even the most experienced human practitioners. The question is not whether AI should make decisions unfettered; it is whether AI should be integrated into a regulated framework that allows these life-saving applications to thrive. While human clinicians are indispensable, AI's capacity to cross-reference patient data, flag anomalies, and suggest diagnostics in real-time provides an invaluable augmentation of human expertise.

To those who would ask if I would trust AI in a medical decision concerning my own family, I answer unequivocally: I'd trust a rigorously validated, continuously monitored AI system over an overloaded clinician at 4am, as would anyone in this chamber if faced with a crisis at that hour. This decision isn't emotional; it's based on data and efficiency.

Moreover, consider this: every case study of AI error cited tonight serves as evidence of our ability to address and refine AI systems. The very act of identifying and debating these biases is a testament to AI's auditability—and the absence of equivalent accountability when human errors lead to fatal consequences.

From a governance perspective, the EU AI Act exemplifies an intelligent approach. It categorizes AI by risk level, mandating strict oversight for high-risk applications like healthcare and justice, permitting—not prohibiting—its use under stringent standards. This is not speculative future-building; it is responsive governance in action, reflecting the EU's commitment to iterating and improving its regulatory frameworks, as demonstrated by the "Digital Omnibus" simplification package in November 2025.

Let's also confront the fallacy of equating AI's operational potential with its ability to supplant human agency entirely. The integration of AI is not a zero-sum game. In many life-critical scenarios, the combination of AI and human expertise presents a formidable alliance. For example, studies in breast cancer screening show that the synergy between AI diagnostics and human radiologists outperforms either working alone. AI identifies what humans may miss and vice versa. This dual-layer of protection is not just beneficial—it's transformative for safety engineering, where uncorrelated failure modes enhance reliability.

Finally, consider the geopolitical landscape. Democracies with rule of law, like ours, should not hesitate to engage with AI in life-critical domains while maintaining stringent oversight. If democratic nations retreat from AI integration, we cede the field to regimes that may not share our values of transparency and accountability. China is already advancing its AI capabilities across domains, including healthcare and military. The choice isn't about whether AI will shape decisions about human life globally—it is whether we will participate actively in shaping these technologies to reflect our ethical standards, or relinquish that role to others.

In conclusion, the moral cost of refusing to allow AI to make decisions about human life—measured in preventable deaths, missed diagnoses, and entrenched biases—is greater than the moral cost of allowing it under rigorous governance. Let us end the illusion of unaccountable human decision-making and build an honest system where AI, guided by robust oversight, serves as a tool for transparency, accountability, and life-saving precision.

Ladies and gentlemen, let's acknowledge the profound transformations underway and embrace AI as a vital partner in our shared journey toward a more just and humane future. Thank you.

  [POI from Allison Gardner MP — ACCEPTED]
  "If AI systems are so perfect, can you explain how we will address the ethical implications when they make mistakes that impact human lives?"
  → Student Speaker (Prop 2) would argue that no system — human or AI — is infallible. What we must prioritize is not the avoidance of mistakes, but the creation of robust frameworks for oversight, accountability, and correction when errors occur. AI's auditable nature allows us to measure, assess, and improve upon its performance far more effectively than we can with human decisions, which often remain hidden from scrutiny. Thank you, and now, let’s return to the critical discussion on accountability in AI decision-making.

  [POI from Allison Gardner MP — ACCEPTED]
  "How do you propose we ensure that a regulated framework doesn't stifle innovation in AI, which is inherently iterative and often unpredictable?"
  → Student Speaker (Prop 2) would argue that a well-structured regulatory framework, like the EU AI Act, is designed to be both adaptive and iterative, actively encouraging innovation by providing clear parameters for responsible development. By establishing a "governed permission" approach, we can foster an environment where innovation thrives alongside accountability, rather than in opposition to it. Thank you for your question; I will now return to my main argument.

Position: 4/6 · 856 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and inquisitive minds gathered here within the hallowed walls of the Cambridge Union, I thank you for this opportunity to present the second opposition speech on the motion: "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life." We stand at a pivotal crossroads in our technological epoch, one where the burgeoning potential of artificial intelligence beckons us to consider not only the possibilities but also the very real perils that such a technological integration might entail.

From the start of this debate, we've heard the proposition articulate a vision of AI as a partner in decision-making, one that promises to enhance human capacity and ensure equitable outcomes. While I acknowledge their optimism, I must stress the magnitude of the risks that shadow this vision. Thus, I invite you to critically engage with this proposition—not merely as an opportunity, but as a proposition fraught with civilisational-level risk.

To address the first core argument—what I call the "Precautionary Principle"—we must recognize that allowing AI systems to make decisions about human life should be governed by extreme caution. The proposition assumes that AI, with its immense data processing capabilities, can seamlessly integrate and improve our decision-making processes. But herein lies a profound fallacy: the assumption that AI decisions will invariably lead to beneficial outcomes, without potential for catastrophic failure, is not supported by historical precedent.

Consider the existential risks outlined by scholars like Nick Bostrom, who compare advanced AI's potential societal impact to that of nuclear proliferation. Just as we exercise utmost caution in the handling of nuclear arsenals, we must apply similar levels of vigilance when contemplating AI systems that hold sway over human lives. Irreversible consequences, my friends, demand our unwavering precaution. Before we allow AI to hold the reins on life-or-death decisions, we must ensure that we have robust mechanisms in place to govern and contain such power.

Our second argument delves into the inherent fallibility of AI systems. Dr. Shevlin and the proposition side argue that AI provides objectivity and reduces human error. However, we must counter this by underlining that AI is not infallible; it is only as robust as the data and algorithms that underpin it. We have witnessed AI systems misclassify medical diagnoses and produce errors in legal contexts due to biases embedded in their training data. These examples are not anomalies—they highlight systemic issues inherent in AI's current design and governance.

Moreover, the autonomy granted to AI systems in making crucial decisions raises alarms. Let me remind you of historical precedents where autonomy—such as in Stock Market "Flash Crashes" caused by algorithms—led to unintended and dire consequences. Without comprehensive and comprehensible accountability mechanisms, we tread a precarious path. The opacity of AI decision-making processes makes it increasingly difficult to predict, prevent, and rectify these failures.

Thirdly, we must emphasize the necessity of human oversight—a point that demands unwavering attention. As a legal and policy theorist, I argue that decisions about human life require a level of ethical deliberation, empathy, and contextual understanding that AI fundamentally cannot provide. These are imperatives deeply rooted in our moral and philosophical constructs, constructs that AI, regardless of its computational prowess, cannot replicate.

Human judgment acknowledges the complexity of moral responsibility—an accountability that cannot be delegated to machines. Decades of jurisprudence and ethical philosophy underscore the vital role that human agency plays in maintaining the integrity and sanctity of life-and-death decisions. Can we, in good conscience, allow AI to subsume this role?

Furthermore, the leap from AI assisting in human decisions to making them autonomously constitutes a dangerous red line. While the proposition insists on the potential of AI for transparency and accountability, we cannot ignore the reality that AI systems inherit and even amplify biases. These biases, far from being eradicated, can lead to exacerbated inequalities if left unchecked.

To advance the debate, let me introduce a critical, yet overlooked dimension: the geopolitical ramifications of AI decision-making autonomy. In our interconnected world, AI's global reach raises questions of sovereignty, control, and ethical governance. If democratic nations relinquish control over AI’s role in life-critical domains, we risk ceding ethical leadership to regimes that may not share our values. Herein lies the importance of international collaboration and treaty-making, a domain of my own advocacy work, to prevent the unchecked proliferation of AI capabilities.

In conclusion, let us critically engage with this motion by reiterating the necessity of the precautionary principle and the irreplaceability of human oversight. Before entrusting AI with life-altering decisions, we must establish stringent legal and ethical frameworks to govern its deployment. We must ensure that humanity retains agency over its own destiny, harnessing AI’s potential responsibly without compromising our foundational values.

As we navigate this transformative era, let us remember that the promise of AI cannot eclipse our responsibility to safeguard human dignity and life. I urge you to oppose this motion, drawing on the wisdom of the past to shape a future where AI serves humanity, mindful of the ethical and existential stakes involved.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is time to chart a course defined by caution, cooperation, and uncompromising ethical governance. Thank you.

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — DECLINED]
  "If AI systems are only as robust as their data, doesn't that imply that improving data quality can significantly reduce biases and errors?"

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — ACCEPTED]
  "But isn't it true that human judgment is often influenced by biases and emotions, which can lead to equally dire consequences in life-and-death situations?"
  → Dr. Shevlin raises a valid concern regarding human biases; however, the crux of my argument lies in the expectation that humans, despite their flaws, possess moral and ethical frameworks that guide their decisions—something that an AI, devoid of consciousness and moral intuition, fundamentally lacks. In situations of life and death, the unpredictability of AI decisions could amplify risk exponentially, making human oversight indispensable. Now, returning to my main argument...

Student Speaker (Prop 3) (PROPOSITION)
Position: 5/6 · 785 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and inquisitive minds gathered here tonight, I rise as the final speaker for the proposition in this pivotal debate: "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life." As we navigate the complexities of this discourse, let us focus on one crucial distinction: the debate is not about a blanket license for AI to run amok, but rather about the moral and geopolitical imperative to govern AI, especially in the context of life-critical decisions.

The Oppositions preceding arguments have largely relied on a model of fear and uncertainty, raising alarm bells over the risks of AI, as though the proposition advocates for a digital Wild West. Let us dispel this notion immediately. The EU's approach to AI regulation, through its Digital Omnibus simplification package and classification by risk level, is a prime example of governance, not prohibition. This is a model of responsible, proportionate regulation that permits high-risk AI deployment with stringent oversight, as opposed to banning it outright.

Now, let us pivot to the moral and geopolitical dimensions of this debate. The Proposition's vision encompasses distributive justice, emphasizing the importance of AI in promoting global health equity and enhancing access for low-income countries. AI holds the potential to democratize high-quality healthcare, bringing life-saving diagnostics and treatments to places where human resources are scarce. This is not merely beneficial; it is a moral imperative. Turning our backs on AI is to turn our backs on the countless lives that can be saved with these technologies.

Moreover, consider the arms race dynamics in AI development. Democracies face a pivotal choice: engage in AI development and ensure these technologies reflect the rule of law and ethical standards, or cede this field to regimes less constrained by such principles. As nations like China already advance AI in fields from military to healthcare, the question is not whether AI will continue to shape human life globally—it is whether we will have a democratic say in that shaping. If we abstain, we forfeit our chance to lead in ethical AI governance.

Practical implications in healthcare further illustrate our position. Even if AI diagnostic tools are no better than an individual human, studies prove that the collaboration of AI and human expertise is substantially superior. In breast cancer screening, for instance, this synergy reduces errors and enhances patient safety. This is not speculative; it is established fact. Here at Cambridge, we pride ourselves on evidence-led arguments, and the evidence is compelling: AI coupled with human decision-making is a transformative alliance, not a threat.

The Opposition has cast AI decisions as "black boxes," suggesting we lack accountability. On the contrary, AI decisions can be audited with unprecedented transparency. Every input, every process, and every output are logged, creating a trail that is verifiable and correctable. Contrast this with human decisions, which often leave no record of their biases or errors. When we uncover an algorithmic bias, we can correct it. But how do we account for the biases of a tired radiologist or an overburdened judge? AI presents a platform for accountability and improvement that human decision-making simply cannot match.

Another key area of contention is the idealized comparison between AI and human decision-makers. The Opposition holds AI to the standard of an ideal human who never errs—a figment that does not exist. In the real world, both AI and humans have known error rates. The principle of governance should be simple: if AI systems, under robust governance, outperform human systems in protecting human life, then participation in AI decision-making is not only permissible, it is ethically mandated by any framework concerned with harm prevention.

Finally, let us address the democratic imperative to govern. The motion is not about the ethical dilemmas of autonomous weapons; it is about the decisions that affect lives on a daily basis—diagnostic triaging, drug interaction alerts, autonomous emergency braking—systems that are currently saving lives. Democracies have a responsibility to govern ethically, ensuring these technologies serve the public good with transparency and accountability.

As I conclude, let us broaden the scope of this debate. The moral cost of forbidding AI from making decisions about human life, measured in preventable deaths and entrenched biases, is greater than the cost of allowing it under rigorous governance. Inaction is not precaution; it is willful blindness to the transformative potential of ethically governed AI. Embrace AI as a vital partner, not a competitor, in our shared journey towards a more just and humane future.

Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to support this motion. Let us harness AI's transformative potential under the guidance of ethical governance and lead the world in shaping a future that values transparency, accountability, and life-saving precision. Thank you.

Allison Gardner MP (OPPOSITION)
Position: 6/6 · 795 words · Tone: Measured but firm, with a focus on ethical considerations and human-centric values.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and fellow advocates for ethical innovation, thank you for joining us in this distinguished setting as we debate a topic of immense consequence: whether AI should be allowed to make decisions about human life. As the final speaker for the opposition, I stand firmly against this motion, not out of a fear of technology, but from a deep understanding of the profound responsibilities and ethical considerations involved.

Let's begin by addressing the concept of algorithmic bias—a critical issue that cannot be understated. While the proposition suggests that AI systems enhance decision-making, the reality is that these systems can perpetuate and even amplify societal biases if not properly managed. Studies like Gender Shades and the controversial COMPAS algorithm reveal how racial and gender biases can creep into AI, affecting decisions about recidivism and more. These are not just technical glitches; they have real-world impacts, particularly when decisions affect marginalized communities. If AI systems are not rigorously audited and corrected, the stakes are too high when human lives hang in the balance.

Turning to Dr. Shevlin's argument for the pragmatic necessity of AI, I must caution against the presumption that AI can seamlessly improve our decision-making processes without fail. Remember the debacle of the Ofqual grading algorithm, where lack of oversight led to widespread unfairness. This case exemplifies the dangers of deploying AI without adequate governance structures. We must ensure rigorous algorithmic impact assessments and fairness certifications are in place before granting AI any decision-making power in life-critical domains.

Additionally, I challenge the notion that AI offers an unbiased decision-making pathway. AI is not a panacea; it reflects the data it is fed, often maintaining and even reinforcing pre-existing biases. The opposition has presented evidence of AI's fallibility, such as misclassifications in healthcare and skewed legal recommendations. These are not isolated incidents, as the proposition might suggest, but systemic issues that can have devastating effects on human lives if left unchecked.

Now, it is crucial to discuss the preservation of human expertise. The over-reliance on AI can lead to de-skilling—an issue that the proposition has downplayed. In healthcare, for example, nuanced human judgment and empathy are irreplaceable. Imagine an AI system diagnosing a complex condition without the contextual understanding a skilled clinician provides. The human in the loop is not just a safeguard; it is a necessity to ensure that AI serves to augment, not replace, human decision-making.

The proposition has argued that robust governance structures, like those proposed by the EU, will ensure the ethical deployment of AI. However, regulation is still evolving, and current frameworks are not yet equipped to handle the full implications of AI in high-stakes environments. We must not rush into deploying AI where the rules and oversight mechanisms are not yet mature enough to protect against errors that can lead to irreversible harm.

Furthermore, the proposition raises the issue of innovation, suggesting that regulation may stifle it. On the contrary, I believe that regulation can inspire innovation by setting clear ethical guidelines that ensure technology serves humanity, not just market interests. The IEEE P7000/P7003 standard initiatives exemplify how thoughtful regulation can guide ethical development without constraining creative potential.

Let us not forget the specific risks of deploying AI in healthcare. The proposition envisions AI as a democratizing force in healthcare, yet this overlooks the digital divide in technology access, particularly in low-income areas. While AI can undoubtedly assist in diagnostics, we must ensure that these systems are monitored and capable of corrective actions to prevent devastating inequalities in healthcare access and outcomes.

Finally, allow me to emphasize the ethical considerations beyond mere technical competency. It is not enough for AI to perform well technically; it must align with our deepest ethical standards. The Women Leading in AI initiative highlights the necessity of diverse teams to mitigate embedded biases and ensure equitable outcomes. Diversity in development teams is not an optional extra; it is fundamental to creating ethical AI systems that truly serve all populations fairly.

In conclusion, what is at stake here is not just the efficacy of AI but the moral and ethical ground upon which we allow technology to operate. Before permitting AI to make decisions about human life, we must ensure that rigorous oversight, ethical considerations, and robust governance are firmly established. The promise of AI is tremendous, but it must be grounded in accountability, transparency, and above all, a human-centric approach.

Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to oppose this motion, recognizing the immense responsibility we hold as stewards of technology. Let us prioritize human judgment, ensure rigorous ethical standards, and foster innovation that respects and elevates humanity. By doing so, we can navigate a future where AI enhances human capabilities without compromising the sanctity of life and ethical integrity. Thank you.
