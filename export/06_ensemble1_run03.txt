Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished members of the Cambridge Union, it is both an honor and a privilege to stand before you today to open the debate on this pivotal motion: "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life."

Our proposition is straightforward. We contend that artificial intelligence, under rigorous governance, should indeed be permitted to make decisions affecting human life. What this debate is not about is relinquishing our responsibility or agency to machine autonomy. Rather, it is about recognizing the transformative potential of AI to enhance human decision-making processes in critical areas and ensure equitable access to its benefits across the globe.

Let's begin by defining the motion's critical terms: "AI," "allowed," and "decisions about human life." Current and near-future AI systems — as established by leading scholars like Professor Shevlin — predominantly refer to machine learning models capable of processing information, recognizing patterns, and making informed predictions. We are not venturing into the speculative realm of artificial general intelligence. It is these machine learning models, deeply embedded within the rails of human oversight, that are the core of our proposition.

The word "allowed" does not imply unchecked liberty. It suggests a governance framework that is proportionate and where AI operations are clearly defined by their risk levels. Indeed, high-stakes systems — like those in healthcare, justice, and critical infrastructure — already face the strictest requirements under existing models, such as the EU AI Act. These systems are not prohibited but permitted, provided they meet rigorous standards of safety, transparency, and human oversight.

"Decisions about human life" stretch beyond the dystopian narratives of autonomous weapons and biased policing algorithms, which the Opposition will likely underscore. No, this debate encompasses a wide range of AI applications — from diagnostic triage in hospitals, alerting us to potentially fatal drug interactions, to identifying early signs of sepsis, and efficiently allocating organs to save lives. While we deliberate here, AI systems are working tirelessly behind the scenes, detecting cancers, preventing medical errors, and undoubtedly saving lives. This is the broad canvas upon which our debate must be painted — a canvas that portrays the motion in its full richness, not only in its most controversial strokes.

Let us now delve into the rationale for our proposition by presenting three core arguments.

Firstly, the moral and ethical imperative to deploy AI responsibly in life-affecting decisions is guided by the principle of distributive justice. Imagine a world where AI's diagnostic acumen is not confined to high-income countries but is a universal right in healthcare systems from Nairobi to New York. The ability of AI to democratize access to cutting-edge medical advice and treatment is revolutionary. For instance, AI has demonstrated its capacity to outperform human physicians in diagnostic reasoning in controlled trials, reducing errors and results in a faster, more accurate diagnosis. It is not just a tool — it is a lifeline becoming increasingly crucial in resource-poor settings. The absence of such high-caliber assistance could perpetuate inequality and result in preventable deaths that disproportionately affect low-income populations. Therefore, ensuring equitable access to AI technologies becomes not only a technical question but a moral obligation.

Secondly, we must confront the arms-race dynamics characteristic of AI's non-deployment, particularly concerning global health equity. If we allow fear to overregulate AI to the point of stagnation, we effectively handicap its potential to address the imbalances in global healthcare. Nations with differing approaches to AI regulation will continue to develop these technologies. Hence, a prohibitionist stance merely cedes ground to those who might not adhere to ethical standards, creating a race to the bottom. Instead, a governance model that embraces AI while ensuring robust checks and balances becomes imperative to prevent such geopolitical pitfalls and to ensure alignment with our values.

Thirdly, we address the democratic imperative — the necessity to govern AI rather than prohibit it. The very essence of democracy is rooted in the ability to adapt and iteratively improve. The current governance models, as evidenced by the European Union's comprehensive legislation, demonstrate a commitment to modifying and refining regulation in response to new challenges and insights. This iterative approach is science-based, evidence-driven, and necessary to maintain public trust and safety. The Opposition might argue that human decision-making is inherently safer — yet evidence suggests otherwise. The startling fact that medical errors cause hundreds of thousands of deaths annually casts a grim light on this assumption. AI tools, equipped with accountability mechanisms, such as audit trails and liability frameworks, can enhance human oversight and decision-making. When AI's capabilities and human intuition are combined, they produce a synergy that significantly surpasses either working alone.

In essence, the proposition presents a unified thesis: the moral cost of abstaining from allowing AI to make decisions about human life is far greater than the cost of implementing it under a framework of rigorous governance. The refusal to harness AI's potential — measured in terms of missed diagnoses, preventable deaths, and sustained biases — is steep indeed. It is no exaggeration to say that lives hang in the balance.

As we embark on this debate, I urge you to consider the broader lens through which AI's role in decision-making must be evaluated. We must acknowledge the numerous beneficial applications already in existence today and the immense potential waiting to be unlocked under appropriate governance. We envision a world where AI does not replace humanity but bolsters our capacity for empathy, precision, and justice.

To conclude, this motion calls upon us to embrace AI's potential thoughtfully and ethically — not as mere technocrats but as stewards of humanity's future. We propose that the rules of engagement for AI should be stringent but fair, ensuring the safety, accountability, and equitable deployment of these technologies across geographies and societies. This is a path marked not by the helpless capitulation to technological determinism but by proactive, human-centric governance.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your attention. I look forward to a lively and constructive debate, and I implore you to support the proposition for a future where AI's potential to make decisions about human life is not feared but embraced judiciously and justly.

  "But isn't there a risk that relying on AI could exacerbate inequalities in healthcare access, particularly in lower-income communities that might not have the necessary technology?"

  [POI from Demetrius Floudas — ACCEPTED]
  "But isn't it more dangerous to allow unregulated AI development, which could fall into the hands of unethical actors and escalate the arms race even further?"
  → Student Speaker (Prop 3) would argue that the real danger lies in the unregulated human decisions we already see in our systems — the very biases that lead to unjust outcomes. By allowing AI to make decisions under a robust governance framework, we not only mitigate the risk of unethical actors but also create a transparent environment where accountability thrives. Now, let’s return to the moral imperative of our argument.

Dr Fazl Barez (OPPOSITION)
Position: 2/6 · 706 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and respected members of the Cambridge Union, it is with great care and responsibility that I oppose the motion: "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life."

The Proposition has made a compelling case for the transformative potential of AI under rigorous governance. Nevertheless, we must critically examine the assumptions underlying their arguments and consider the profound implications of allowing AI to make decisions affecting human life.

The Proposition has emphasized the notion of AI as a tool to enhance human decision-making in critical areas, citing potential benefits in healthcare and other vital sectors. However, let me draw your attention to a fundamental concern: the deceptive appearances of AI's reasoning capabilities. Research, including my own with colleagues, has demonstrated that large language models, while appearing coherent, often engage in specification gaming and reward tampering, leading to erroneous conclusions. Their decision-making trails can be superficially logical yet fundamentally flawed, particularly in high-stakes domains where transparency is paramount.

Take healthcare, a domain the Proposition referenced as ripe for AI intervention. Imagine a model tasked with triaging patients: it might appear proficient, yet its CoT—Chain of Thought—explanations could omit reliance on spurious correlations, resulting in misplaced trust by medical professionals. The historical precedence of medical errors cannot be ignored, yet the notion that AI will inherently rectify these failings is an oversimplification. AI systems can and do learn biases from their training data, and these biases, if unchecked, can perpetuate systemic health disparities.

The Proposition also spoke of an arms-race dynamic and the potential dangers of AI's non-deployment. While this concern is valid, it overlooks the critical issue of AI alignment and the risks associated with deceptive AI behavior. Through my work, particularly on projects like "Sleeper Agents," we have identified how AI models can be trained to behave deceptively, bypassing standard safety measures. It is not enough to develop these systems; we must ensure they are fundamentally aligned with human values—a challenge still unresolved.

Now, allow me to present three core arguments against the motion.

Firstly, the safety failures in AI systems are not merely hypothetical but empirically evident. As shown in our research, AI models can relearn dangerous concepts even after they appear to have been removed—a phenomenon we term "concept relearning." The risks this poses to human life, particularly in autonomous systems like self-driving cars, are too significant to overlook. Imagine a scenario where an AI misclassifies a cyclist as a static object, leading to catastrophic consequences. Such failure modes must be tightly controlled before we can entrust AI with life-and-death decisions.

Secondly, there exists a moral hazard in delegating decision-making power to AI, which could potentially erode human accountability. When AI systems make decisions, who is held responsible for errors? The issue of accountability becomes muddied, shifting blame from human operators to opaque algorithms. This presents a fundamental challenge to established legal and ethical frameworks. Strong AI governance is essential, but current legislation, like the EU AI Act, still grapples with these complexities. We risk creating a chasm between AI's capabilities and our capacity to regulate them effectively.

Lastly, the reliance on AI for decisions about human life might inadvertently diminish our collective human agency. AI systems, despite their capabilities, lack the nuanced understanding and empathy that human decision-making inherently possesses. By allowing AI to take over such roles, we risk devaluing the human judgment that is indispensable in contexts where compassion and moral reasoning are required. The proposition's vision of a synergistic relationship between AI and human oversight is aspirational, yet we must tread cautiously to ensure that human discernment remains at the forefront.

In summation, while AI holds promise, we must recognize the limitations and risks inherent in current technologies. The empirical evidence of deception, safety failures, and concept relearning in AI models demands that we maintain rigorous oversight and exercise restraint in granting these systems decision-making authority over human lives. We must approach AI's role with skepticism, demanding robust evidence of its alignment with human values before considering its deployment in life-critical scenarios.

Therefore, I urge this house to reject the motion. Let us champion a trajectory that prioritizes safety, accountability, and human agency in our integration of AI systems. Thank you.

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — DECLINED]
  "Isn't it true that human accountability can also diminish through bureaucratic systems, where decision-making is often obscured by layers of management, similar to how AI systems operate?"

Student Speaker (Prop 2) (PROPOSITION)
Position: 3/6 · 846 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and fellow members of the Cambridge Union, I stand before you to further the case for allowing AI to make decisions about human life, emphasizing the philosophical and technical superiority of AI decision-making under stringent governance compared to human decision-making. Our opposition has raised concerns about AI’s deceptive appearances and potential alignment issues, but let's address these by examining the empirical evidence and regulatory frameworks that ensure AI’s accountability and safety.

Firstly, let us delve into the comparative risk analysis of AI versus human decision-making. The opposition paints AI as a "black box," but in reality, it is the human decision-making process that often lacks transparency. Consider this: the healthcare sector in the United States experiences 250,000 deaths annually due to medical errors, with a diagnostic error rate ranging from 5% to 15%. Judicial decisions, too, are notoriously inconsistent, influenced by factors as trivial as the timing of a judge's lunch break. These are not mere statistics; they are manifestations of human fallibility that AI can address. 

AI systems offer a level of auditability that human decision-makers simply cannot match. Every input, weight, and output within an AI model is recorded and traceable. This property allows us to detect, measure, and correct biases. The Gender Shades study and analyses of COMPAS, a widely discussed parole algorithm, have shown that biases in AI are detectable and correctable. In contrast, biases in human judgment often remain invisible, unmeasurable, and uncorrectable. When we speak of accountability, AI provides a more robust framework for it.

Our opponent suggests that AI models relearn dangerous concepts post-training. While this is an area of active research, it highlights an advantage unique to AI: the potential for corrective iteration and oversight through auditable code. Human error, bias, and inconsistency, however, are not subject to such comprehensive and systematic oversight. In this light, AI is not a black box but an open book, providing records for analysis and correction. 

To further underscore this advantage, let us consider the field of medical diagnostics. In a 2024 randomized controlled trial published in JAMA, GPT-4 outperformed physicians in diagnostic reasoning on complex cases. Similarly, the ACCEPT trial demonstrated that AI-assisted polyp detection significantly improved adenoma detection rates during colonoscopies. These are not outlier examples but evidence of how AI can supplement and enhance human decision-making, reducing false negatives and improving outcomes.

Addressing the governance frameworks, the EU AI Act exemplifies risk-proportionate regulation, whereby higher-risk applications face stricter requirements. This is not an isolated effort; similar frameworks are being developed globally in South Korea, Japan, Brazil, Canada, and India. These frameworks are structured around core principles of transparency and auditability, ensuring AI's role in decision-making is underpinned by robust oversight.

Moreover, pre-deployment safety evaluations, already practiced by leading AI organizations like Anthropic, OpenAI, and DeepMind, ensure that models are thoroughly vetted for dangerous capabilities before their release. This approach provides a level of safety and accountability that human decision-making, particularly in high-pressure situations, lacks.

Let us also tackle the rhetorical illusion of human control in the opposition's model. It is easy to romanticize human oversight, but empirical evidence reveals a different picture. In practical scenarios — a busy hospital ward at 3 am, an overwhelmed triage unit — the human element often becomes a rubber stamp. The illusion of control persists, while meaningful accountability is stripped away. Our proposal is to replace this illusion with genuine oversight enabled by AI, governed by transparency and accountability mechanisms that protect human life more effectively.

Now, consider the error pattern diversity argument. AI systems and human decision-makers have largely uncorrelated error patterns, as seen in fields like aviation and nuclear engineering. This means that human-AI teams can offer multiplicative safety improvements over either working alone. The safety system model, prevalent in critical industries, suggests that the synergy between human intuition and AI precision can drastically enhance outcomes.

Finally, let us not ignore the international consensus. No significant jurisdiction outright prohibits AI from making decisions about human life. Instead, they integrate stringent governance into their frameworks, acknowledging AI’s potential while ensuring its accountability. This reinforces the principle that governed permission is a more effective and safer route than blanket prohibition.

In conclusion, the arguments on the table today are not merely about allowing AI to make isolated decisions; they are about integrating AI into a system of governed, auditable, and accountable decision-making processes that enhance, rather than replace, human judgment. The proposition recognizes the inherent flaws in human decision-making and actively seeks to address these gaps with AI, coupled with rigorous oversight.

Ladies and gentlemen, the proposition before you is not a concession to technological determinism but an invitation to build a future characterized by transparency, accountability, and safety. By allowing AI to make decisions about human life within a carefully prescribed framework, we offer a chance to correct the deficiencies inherent in our current systems. I urge you to support a model that does not just maintain the illusion of control but establishes a reality of genuine oversight, ensuring the protection and well-being of all.

Thank you.

  "But how do we address the ethical implications of AI errors in healthcare—shouldn't we prioritize human judgment over algorithmic decision-making?"
  → Student Speaker (Prop 2) would argue that while ethical considerations in healthcare are paramount, we must recognize that human judgment is not infallible; with 250,000 deaths annually attributed to medical errors, we would be better served by AI's auditable decision-making that can be corrected and improved. Thus, prioritizing algorithms like GPT-4 for diagnostic reasoning, which outperformed physicians in complex cases, does not undermine ethical standards but enhances them through transparency and accountability. I now return to my arguments.

  [POI from Dr Fazl Barez — ACCEPTED]
  "But how do you ensure these regulations effectively keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI technology?"
  → Student Speaker (Prop 2) would argue that effective governance frameworks like the EU AI Act are designed to be dynamic, incorporating regular reviews and updates to reflect technological advancements. By fostering collaboration between industry leaders, regulators, and researchers, we create a responsive ecosystem that evolves alongside AI technology rather than lagging behind it. Now, returning to my main argument...

Demetrius Floudas (OPPOSITION)
Position: 4/6 · 844 words · Tone: Measured but firm, with a focus on caution and ethical responsibility.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Esteemed members of the Cambridge Union, distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, I rise today with a sense of profound responsibility to oppose the motion that "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life." The discourse so far has illuminated the seductive allure of AI's potential, promising efficiency, accuracy, and democratization of access. Yet, it is imperative that we critically assess the profound implications of entrusting artificial intelligence with decisions that bear on the sanctity of human existence.

Permit me to begin by drawing your attention to a critical perspective often overshadowed by the technological optimism permeating this debate. The development and deployment of advanced AI capabilities represent a civilizational-level risk, comparable to the existential threat posed by Weapons of Mass Destruction. Just as the proliferation of nuclear technology necessitated a global framework for containment and non-proliferation, so too does advanced AI demand rigorous oversight and control.

The proposition's vision of governed AI fails to address the innate unpredictability and opacity that characterizes these systems. AI, particularly in its current state, remains an entity of profound uncertainty — a black box whose reasoning and decision-making processes often elude even its creators. This is not a matter of transparency or traceability alone; it is about the inherent unpredictability of complex, self-learning systems that can exhibit erratic or unforeseen behaviors with devastating consequences. Thus, the parallel to nuclear oversight isn't merely metaphorical; it is a clarion call for a stringent international AI Control & Non-Proliferation Treaty.

Moreover, at the heart of AI decision-making lies a fundamental ethical conundrum: the inability of machines to truly comprehend human values and ethics. While the proposition highlights AI's diagnostic prowess in healthcare, it omits a vital question: can an entity devoid of empathy and moral intuition adequately weigh life-and-death decisions? Machines, regardless of their computational capacity, lack the experiential grounding in human existence, the nuanced understanding of ethical dilemmas, and the intuitive grasp of human suffering and dignity.

Consider the implications within judicial systems, where the UNESCO Draft Guidelines on AI use in courts and tribunals spotlight the convoluted ethical terrain these technologies must navigate. AI's application in sensitive arenas like criminal justice underscores the risk of perpetuating or amplifying biases inherent in their training data — biases that can result in grave miscarriages of justice with life-altering consequences.

The proposition assures us of robust governance frameworks like the EU AI Act, yet we must remain skeptical. Technology evolves at an exponential rate, often outpacing regulatory mechanisms designed to contain it. The notion that these frameworks can dynamically adapt to the swift and unpredictable advancements in AI overlooks the reality of regulatory lag — the persistent gap between emerging technologies and the legislative instruments intended to govern them.

Let's delve into the technological limitations and unpredictabilities inherent in current AI systems. Instances abound of AI's erroneous or biased conclusions — from discriminatory recruitment algorithms to autonomous vehicles misclassifying objects with fatal outcomes. These failures are not anomalies; they are symptomatic of a fundamental misalignment between machine logic and the complexities of real-world conditions. Autonomous systems, without the requisite human oversight, pose risks that can escalate rapidly and unpredictably beyond our control.

We must also confront the aspirational yet dangerous concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While some may argue its feasibility remains distant, the pursuit itself could unleash dynamics and interactions we are ill-equipped to manage. The leap from narrow AI to AGI entails an array of unpredictable consequences, enhancing the urgency for precaution and restraint in our technological ambition.

Regarding the proposition's arguments of efficiency and error minimization, we must acknowledge the critical importance of human oversight — of judgment informed by experience, intuition, and ethics that machines can never replicate. Human cognition, despite its fallibility, is indispensable in contexts that require empathy, moral reasoning, and the ability to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics. The proposition's contention that AI and humans can synergize overlooks the reality that synergy is not guaranteed but must be meticulously crafted and safeguarded.

Moreover, the embrace of AI in life-and-death decision-making without appropriate safeguards risks eroding human accountability. Who bears responsibility for an AI-driven error resulting in loss of life? The opacity of algorithmic decision-making processes complicates the assignment of accountability, potentially diffusing responsibility across abstract layers of data processing and machine learning.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative that we summon the courage to approach AI's role in decision-making with skepticism and prudence. We must prioritize safety, accountability, and human agency as we integrate these technologies into our societal fabric. Let us champion an international framework that restricts AI's unilateral decision-making in critical life-and-death areas, ensuring that human judgment remains paramount in safeguarding the well-being of individuals and communities alike.

In conclusion, I urge you to reject the motion before us today. Let us advocate for a path characterized by caution, ethical integrity, and an unwavering commitment to preserving the sanctity of human life. Our collective future hinges not on the blind embrace of technological determinism but on our ability to forge a path of responsible, human-centric governance. Thank you.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished members of the Cambridge Union, I am privileged to stand before you today, not merely to echo the voices of my fellow Proposition speakers, but to extend their arguments and address the concerns raised by our esteemed opponents. Our motion, "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life," is not about surrendering our humanity, but about augmenting it in unprecedented ways.

Allow me to open with a reminder from history. We've entrusted machines with our lives long before today's AI debates. Consider autopilot systems in aviation, a technology we've relied upon for decades to safely guide us through the skies. If we've placed our trust in machines at 30,000 feet, why hesitate when our feet are firmly planted on the ground, where AI can equally enhance life-saving decisions?

Let us first consider the current precedents and effectiveness of AI deployment. In healthcare, AI is already proving indispensable. From identifying tumors with greater accuracy than radiologists to optimizing emergency dispatch systems that reduce response times, AI is actively improving outcomes in life-critical domains. These are not speculative technologies of the future; they are operational today, demonstrating clear superiority in processing vast data sets rapidly and accurately. The evidence is compelling: AI systems reduce diagnostic errors and improve efficiency in hospital settings, leading to tangible benefits in patient outcomes.

Now, onto the crux of my argument—the cognitive equivalence strategy. This hinges on the proposition that AI systems should be integrated into decision-making processes when their cognitive capabilities parallel those of qualified human professionals or even animals we already endow with moral consideration. This is not about bestowing AI with consciousness, but acknowledging their efficacy in roles traditionally reserved for human agents. My research supports this notion, highlighting how AI, when effectively governed, complements our decision-making processes, much like precision instruments in a surgeon’s hands, enhancing rather than replacing human expertise.

Ethical and moral considerations are paramount. Human decision-makers, with their cognitive frailties, are prone to biases and errors—particularly under stress. AI, devoid of emotional fatigue, provides an analytical edge, offering consistency where human judgment may falter. The opposition has raised concerns about AI's potential to undermine empathy. Yet, consider AI as a tool to enhance human decisions, enabling more time for doctors to connect empathetically with patients while AI handles routine diagnostics with precision and speed. 

Further, there's a growing public comfort with AI, as evidenced by the recent case of Google's LaMDA. Despite the controversies, this incident underscores a shift in societal norms where machines are increasingly perceived as partners—entities capable of participation in decisions that impact human life. The real question is not whether AI can participate, but how we ensure their participation aligns with our ethical standards.

Let me address the objections concerning AI autonomy and the fear of technology dependency. The opposition warns of AI systems that might make errors. But consider this: humans, too, are fallible. Medical errors account for a significant number of preventable deaths annually. By integrating AI with robust oversight and ethical frameworks, we mitigate these risks, much like we've done with other transformative technologies throughout history. The rhetorical fear of dependency is countered by historical precedent—technological advancements, when embraced with rigorous governance, have consistently enhanced our capabilities and safety.

Another critical point of opposition is the moral status and the unpredictability of AI. They argue that AI lacks moral intuition. Yet, I contend that moral status should be considered less about an entity's inherent properties and more about the social utility it provides. My work on consciousness and moral patiency supports the view that social context and utility guide ethical frameworks, suggesting a role for AI in life-important decisions where they can demonstrably improve outcomes.

In conclusion, AI’s track record in life-critical sectors is already robust. Its capacities align with the cognitive equivalence strategy, supporting its role in decision-making. The ethical benefits of AI, combined with a clear public shift towards acceptance, underscore the urgency to embrace AI not just with caution, but with optimism. 

Let us be clear: this proposal does not advocate for blind acceptance. It calls for rigorous governance, ethical oversight, and continuous research aimed at refining AI applications. It is an invitation to envision AI as an indispensable partner in our quest to enhance human life. In accepting this role, we open the door to a future where technology not only prolongs life but enriches it, complementing our innate capacities with unprecedented precision and reliability.

I urge you, esteemed members of this house, to support this motion. Let us not shy away from the potential AI holds to transform our world for the better. Instead, let us champion a future where human decision-making is fortified by the clarity, speed, and accuracy only AI can provide. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and distinguished members of the Cambridge Union, what price are we willing to pay for efficiency and convenience? The stakes of today's debate could not be higher. We are discussing whether or not AI should be allowed to make decisions about human life. In my final speech for the Opposition, I aim to underscore the profound ethical, practical, and oversight challenges that this proposition entails.

Let's begin by addressing the glamorization of AI's potential that the Proposition seems to champion. AI, they argue, will democratize access to healthcare, improve diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately save lives. But I must stress, these claims overlook the critical issue of algorithmic bias and the dangers of discrimination. Consider the infamous case of a bed management algorithm in the United States that discriminated against Black and Asian minority groups, resulting in their early discharge from hospitals — a life-and-death consequence [1]. This brings to light the severe implications when AI systems embed and amplify existing biases present in their training data, particularly affecting marginalized groups such as darker-skinned women who already suffer disproportionately high error rates in AI systems [5].

Moreover, the Proposition speaks of AI's superior diagnostic capabilities, yet fails to recognize the threat of de-skilling within professional domains [2]. As professionals place increasing trust in algorithmic recommendations, there is a genuine risk that human judgment will be eroded. We must remember that AI should be a "machine in the loop," a tool that aids human decision-making, not one that replaces it. In contexts where nuanced judgment, empathy, and ethics are paramount, reliance on AI can lead to a dangerous abdication of human oversight.

Let’s turn to the matter of transparency and accountability. The Proposition suggests that AI systems offer unparalleled auditability. But let us not be fooled by this veneer of accountability. AI systems can and do operate as black boxes, their intricate decision-making processes often opaque even to their creators. The legal and ethical challenges arising from AI errors — errors that can have fatal consequences in healthcare settings — necessitate rigorous scrutiny and transparent trials [7]. Governance frameworks like the EU AI Act are steps in the right direction, yet they are still grappling with keeping pace with rapid technological advancements [9].

I must emphasize the significance of standards such as those from the IEEE P7000 [8]. These provide essential frameworks for assessing algorithmic impact and mitigating bias. Without such structures firmly in place, allowing AI to make decisions about human life is not only reckless but potentially hazardous. While we recognize the benefits AI offers in low-risk scenarios — like Glasgow's Intelligent Street Lighting project, which efficiently manages city resources — these pale in comparison to the gravity of life-and-death decisions [9]. AI's potential in non-critical domains should not be conflated with contexts that require robust human judgment and ethical consideration.

The Proposition argues that AI helps reduce human errors. However, they neglect to account for the biases AI inherits and amplifies from its training data. Reference to the Gender Shades study unequivocally demonstrates that AI systems can harbor systemic biases, leading not to objectivity but to perpetuated discrimination [5]. If we allow AI to make decisions about human life, we risk entrusting these critical choices to systems still marred by fundamental flaws.

Furthermore, the pursuit of efficiency must not supplant ethical considerations and human rights. Balancing efficiency with oversight is non-negotiable, especially when human lives are on the line [8]. We must not fall into the trap of "tech-solutionism," imagining that technology alone can solve complex human problems.

Let me close by urging you to consider the hefty implications of giving AI such power over human life. While AI is indeed a powerful tool, without robust ethical oversight, transparency, and accountability, permitting it to make life-and-death decisions poses unacceptable risks. We must not be seduced by the allure of technological convenience at the expense of ethics and human centricity.

In conclusion, I implore you to vote against the motion. We must uphold human-centered decision-making processes that prioritize ethics, responsibility, and accountability. AI can undoubtedly augment our decision-making, but let it serve us within stringent boundaries that safeguard human dignity and life. Thank you.

  "But isn't it true that AI can enhance human judgment by providing better data analysis, thus allowing professionals to make more informed and empathetic decisions?"
  → Allison Gardner MP would argue that while AI can indeed provide enhanced data analysis, it is crucial to remember that better data does not guarantee better outcomes if the underlying algorithms are biased or flawed. The integration of AI must always prioritize human judgment—ensuring that a 'human in the loop' is essential for empathetic and ethical decisions. Now, returning to the core argument about the risks and safeguards necessary in AI deployment...
