Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and honoured guests,

As I stand before you at the Cambridge Union to discuss the motion "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life," I am reminded of an ancient myth. In Greek mythology, there exists a story of Talos, a giant automaton made of bronze, who was tasked with protecting the isle of Crete from invaders. Talos, a creation of divine ingenuity, patrolled the shores with unwavering vigilance. Yet it was believed that at the centre of this mighty being resided a single vein, sealed by a nail, which contained his life's essence. The story of Talos, a precursor to our modern AI systems, invites us to ponder the interplay between human life and intelligent automatons.

Today, we find ourselves at the precipice of an epoch where artificial intelligence could mirror this ancient tale, perhaps not in form but certainly in function. We are called to deliberate on the role of AI in decisions that profoundly affect human life. In setting the stage for our debate, I intend to argue that AI should indeed be permitted to participate in such decisions. Three compelling arguments underpin this stance: the practical necessity of AI in critical decision-making, the potential for enhanced equity and objectivity, and the transformative power of AI in advancing human welfare.

First, let us consider the realm of practical necessity—a domain where AI is already very much a part of the decision-making landscape. It is crucial to acknowledge that artificial intelligence is not a futuristic prospect but a present reality. AI systems currently make life-or-death decisions in numerous contexts. They operate autopilot functions on commercial aircraft, assist in prioritising emergency dispatch for ambulances, and even facilitate blood transfusion routing in hospitals. These systems have proven to be indispensable, offering swift and accurate responses that human operators would struggle to match due to cognitive and physical limitations. Here we see that the necessity of AI stems not from a desire to replace human agency but from a demand for efficiency and reliability where human limitations exist.

Moreover, AI possesses a unique capability for processing vast amounts of data rapidly and accurately. Consider the implications within healthcare—the potential to diagnose diseases faster than any human clinician by analysing patterns across millions of data points, thus providing life-saving interventions more promptly. Or in disaster response scenarios, where AI can predict and guide evacuations and resource allocation, optimising the preservation of life amid chaos. The integration of AI in these contexts is not merely beneficial; it is increasingly indispensable.

Moving to my second argument, let us examine the potential for AI to enhance equity and objectivity in decision-making processes. Human decision-making, as we well know, is fraught with biases—both conscious and unconscious. Our decisions are often swayed by emotions, prejudices, and heuristics. By contrast, AI systems, when designed with ethical considerations and comprehensive datasets, offer the possibility of more objective decision-making processes. Indeed, the advent of machine learning and AI systems brings with it the promise of reducing such biases, or at the very least, identifying and mitigating them systematically.

Consider the judicial system as a case in point. AI systems have been proposed to assist in sentencing by providing judges with insights drawn from vast datasets of similar cases, aiming to ensure consistency and fairness across the board. While I am cautious about overstating the current capabilities of AI in such morally weighty domains, I remain open to the radical potential for these systems to act as valuable tools in our pursuit of justice. In healthcare, an AI's capacity to diagnose without racial, gender, or age bias could be a pivotal step towards equitable health outcomes for all.

Additionally, AI systems have no vested interests, no personal agendas. They do not feel fatigue or rush to judgment in moments of pressure. This feature, when harnessed appropriately, can help level the playing field in areas historically dominated by human error and partiality.

Thirdly, I turn to the transformative power of AI in advancing human welfare. At its core, the development and deployment of AI should aim to improve human life. Embracing AI in decision-making about human life allows us the opportunity to elevate our collective welfare to unprecedented heights. AI is not simply about automating the mundane or replacing the human touch; it is about augmenting human capabilities and expanding the horizon of what is possible when it comes to achieving the greater good.

In the field of medicine, AI is already beginning to revolutionise treatment plans and patient care. AI systems are on the verge of providing personalised medicine tailored to the unique genetic makeup and lifestyle of individuals. Such advancements hold the promise of not only extending life expectancy but also significantly improving the quality of life, particularly for those suffering from chronic conditions.

Furthermore, as we face global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and pandemics, AI offers innovative solutions that transcend national boundaries and human limitations. Whether it be in optimising energy usage to combat climate change or in modeling the spread of diseases to better prepare public health responses, AI is poised to play a pivotal role in the welfare of our planet and its inhabitants.

As we ponder these possibilities, it is worth considering the "cognitive equivalence strategy" I have previously proposed—AI systems warrant moral consideration when their cognitive mechanisms align with those beings we already treat as moral patients. This notion invites us to consider the ethical landscape of AI decision-making not as a binary of permissible or impermissible but as a spectrum of possibilities grounded in cognitive capabilities.

Ladies and gentlemen, the motion before us is not without its complexities and potential pitfalls. I would not be fulfilling my duty if I did not acknowledge the ethical risks associated with social AI—emotional dependence, manipulation, and the over-anthropomorphisation of systems that are not sentient. These concerns are real, and they warrant vigilant oversight and thoughtful regulation. Yet, the existence of these challenges should not deter us from exploring the vast and transformative potential that AI decision-making offers.

In closing, I urge us to envision a future where AI systems serve as partners in our quests for knowledge, health, and justice—a future where the cognitive capabilities of AI are employed to complement our human decision-making processes, enhancing them to levels of precision and fairness hitherto unattainable.

The decision to allow AI to participate in decisions about human life is not a matter of relinquishing control but rather a courageous step towards embracing a transformative tool with the potential to safeguard, improve, and extend lives. As we navigate this uncharted territory, let us do so with open minds, guided by principles of ethics and equity, and with an unwavering commitment to advancing the welfare of all.

Thank you.

  "But isn't it true that AI systems can also perpetuate existing biases if they're trained on flawed data, thus undermining the very equity you claim they enhance?"
  → Dr Henry Shevlin would argue that you are absolutely correct; AI systems can indeed perpetuate biases inherent in their training data, which underscores the critical need for rigorous ethical oversight and diverse datasets. Rather than undermining equity, this challenge presents us with an essential opportunity to refine our AI systems and ensure they reflect a broader range of human experiences and values. Now, to return to my main argument...

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Dr Fazl Barez (OPPOSITION)
Position: 2/6 · 941 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and honoured guests,

As we gather here today to deliberate on the motion, "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life," I must express my concern about the proposition's stance on this deeply consequential subject. The progress we have seen in AI technology is indeed incredible, and while it brings opportunities, it also heralds significant risks that we must scrutinize with a critical eye.

The proposition elegantly invokes the mythology of Talos, an automaton conceived with the purpose of protection. This imagery serves well to inspire, yet it also inadvertently encapsulates the precariousness of relying on artificial mechanisms for tasks that involve human life and welfare. Our task today is to discern whether AI systems, as remarkable as they may be, should ever truly be entrusted with decisions that profoundly affect human life. Dr Henry Shevlin argues in favour, but let us delve critically into the specifics.

Firstly, I agree with the proposition's framework on defining AI, decisions about human life, and human welfare. These definitions are well-considered for the purposes of this debate, yet as we proceed, I wish to highlight the inherent complexities and dangers that exist even within this seemingly well-defined scope.

Dr Shevlin lauds the practical necessity of AI in decision-making, citing examples in healthcare and emergency situations. However, I contend that the current state of AI, despite its capabilities, still suffers from critical issues of brittleness and interpretability. Studies, such as my own work on the brittleness of safety alignment (Wei et al., 2024), demonstrate how AI systems can fail spectacularly under unexpected conditions. These systems, while efficient at data processing, often lack the nuanced understanding that human cognition can provide, especially in scenarios that are laden with ethical nuances. Unlike humans, AIs lack the moral and emotional context necessary for making life-critical decisions, leading to potential oversights that can have dire consequences.

Furthermore, while AI promises enhanced equity and objectivity, the reality is that these systems often inherit and even exacerbate existing biases embedded in their training data. The proposition highlights AI's potential in judicial systems, but fails to acknowledge widely recognized instances where AI tools have perpetuated racial biases in sentencing recommendations. Despite attempts at fairness through algorithmic interventions, a significant challenge remains in ensuring that AI does not simply replicate and reinforce the biases it was meant to eradicate. The work of Williams et al. (2024) on targeted manipulation stresses precisely this concern, revealing how these biases can be subtly but systematically introduced.

Let us consider also the crucial matter of transparency and explainability. The proposition assumes AI systems can act as unbiased decision-makers, yet these systems often operate as black boxes with decisions that are neither transparent nor explainable. It is ethically problematic to allow such opacity in systems that impact human lives. As I have argued in my writings (Barez, 2024), the development of AI systems demands not only technical proficiency but also a robust ethical framework ensuring transparency and accountability. Without clarity in algorithmic decision-making, we risk entering a domain where accountability is obscured, and erroneous outcomes are left unchallenged.

Moreover, I must address the proposition’s portrayal of AI as a panacea for advancing human welfare. While the benefits of AI in fields like personalized medicine and disaster response are undeniable, we must not overlook the potential societal disruptions accompanying these technologies. The rapid integration of technology into domains traditionally managed by human expertise could lead to a loss of crucial skills and exacerbate socio-economic inequalities. This echoes the broader regulatory risks I have discussed (Barez, 2024), where hasty deployment of AI without comprehensive oversight can precipitate unintended societal consequences.

In arguing against this motion, I propose three core counterarguments. First, the risks of misalignment inherent in AI systems highlight the importance of preserving human oversight in any decision involving human life. AI systems can misinterpret data or objectives in ways that deviate from human values—a phenomenon extensively documented in my studies on AI deception (Wen et al., 2024). Until we develop more robust mechanisms for alignment and interpretability, the prospect of fully entrusting AI with life-critical decisions remains fraught with danger.

Second, the ethical considerations of allowing non-human entities to participate in decisions integral to human existence cannot be overstated. The proposition gestures towards ethical regulation, yet does not provide a comprehensive framework for ensuring that AI systems are developed and employed ethically. The nuanced decision-making that human lives depend upon is fundamentally rooted in our moral and empathic capacities, which remain challenging for AI to replicate or even approximate.

Lastly, the resilient nature of concept representations in AI systems means that once flawed or biased concepts are entrenched, they prove exceedingly difficult to mitigate or remove. This underscores the necessity for stringent safeguards and continuous oversight over AI decision-making processes. The reasons behind AI decisions must be thoroughly justifiable and acceptable within human moral frameworks, something we cannot assure with current technology.

In conclusion, while AI holds transformative potential, we must approach its role in decisions about human life with caution, skepticism, and a robust commitment to ethical guidelines. It is imperative that we prioritize the safety, interpretability, and governance of these systems before we venture further into allowing them participation in life-critical decisions. The challenges of AI alignment, bias, and transparency demand that human oversight remains central, not peripheral, in any such circumstances.

As we navigate this intricate landscape, our guiding compass should be the unwavering commitment to ensuring AI systems are not only capable but aligned with our values, transparent in their processes, and ultimately used to augment human judgment rather than replace it.

Thank you.

Position: 3/6 · 747 words · Tone: Measured and persuasive, with a focus on ethical and democratic imperatives.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and honoured guests,

As I take the podium for the final proposition, we stand at a pivotal moment in the case for allowing AI to make decisions about human life. In the face of apprehensions articulated by our esteemed opponents, let's sharpen our focus on the moral and geopolitical imperatives that underscore this debate. This is not just a discussion about technology; it's about our responsibility to harness these tools for the greater good, guided by principles of equity, justice, and democratic governance.

First and foremost, we must recognize the vast potential of AI in advancing distributive justice and global health equity. In low-income countries, where resources are scarce and healthcare professionals are even scarcer, AI can be a transformative force. Consider AI applications that provide diagnostic and treatment recommendations in areas where access to quality healthcare is a distant dream. Algorithms have already outperformed traditional methods in detecting diseases like diabetic retinopathy, providing timely interventions that are otherwise inaccessible. By empowering AI to make certain health decisions, we democratize access to care, addressing critical disparities that have persisted for far too long.

This is not merely a technological question; it's a moral imperative. We must ask ourselves: Is it just to keep denying vulnerable populations the life-saving capabilities AI offers, all because of apprehensions that could be mitigated with proper oversight and governance? The answer is clear — justice demands that we bridge these inequities with the tools at our disposal.

Moving to my second argument, let's consider the unique strengths AI brings to human decision-making through error pattern diversity and accountability. AI systems make different errors from human decision-makers. This was demonstrated in the Grenoble Shockmatrix trial, where AI-human teaming significantly reduced uncorrelated error patterns, leading to improved safety outcomes. Unlike human errors, which often go unnoticed until they cause harm, AI errors are detectable, measurable, and correctable. AI’s functional accountability — where outputs are evaluated, parameters adjusted, and systems decommissioned if needed — is robust compared to the opacity of human decision processes.

The Opposition has raised concerns about AI perpetuating biases. Yet these biases were only uncovered because AI decision-making is auditable and systematic, unlike human biases, which remain hidden. Rejecting AI because we can see its flaws is to choose willful blindness over transparency. Instead, let’s build accountable frameworks that recognize these AI capabilities for responsible use, enhancing our decision-making landscape.

Next, let us explore the democratic imperative to govern AI rather than prohibit it. Opponents argue for caution, yet no major jurisdiction endorses outright prohibition. Instead, nations are actively shaping governance frameworks. The OECD AI Principles, UNESCO's Recommendation on Ethics of AI, and the Council of Europe Framework Convention on AI all embody a collective commitment to regulation, not abandonment. These frameworks signify a global movement towards structured oversight, highlighting a path where democratic societies can lead ethically in AI development.

Prohibition leads to an arms race, where technological advancements progress without the tempering force of accountability and ethical reflection. Democracies must not shy away from this challenge. We must lead by constructing governance structures that balance innovation with ethical constraints, harnessing AI's potential safely and justly.

Finally, let us tackle the practical distinction between AI as an "advisor" versus a "decision-maker." The Opposition may suggest AI should advise, not decide. This is a legal fiction obscuring the reality of AI's role. When AI flags a high probability of sepsis at 3am to a junior doctor lacking the experience to independently verify it, the AI's recommendation is the decision. Labeling AI as merely advisory creates a smokescreen that diminishes accountability and clarity. Honest frameworks that acknowledge AI's decisional role enable proper governance, including audit trails, liability assignment, and appeal mechanisms.

In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the motion before us is not about relinquishing control but embracing a governance model that integrates AI as a responsible partner in decision-making. We must not retreat into fear-driven prohibition but stride forward with informed, ethical, and democratic oversight. Let us harness AI to elevate human capacity, address systemic injustices in healthcare, and tackle global challenges with unprecedented precision and equity.

I urge you to vote for a future where AI is not just a tool but an accountable partner in enhancing human welfare. Together, let's forge a path of responsible progress, driven by a commitment to justice and governance — a path where the transformative potential of AI is aligned with our highest ethical standards and democratic ideals.

Thank you.

  [POI from Dr Fazl Barez — ACCEPTED]
  "If AI can make detectable and correctable errors, how do you address the fact that humans are still needed to interpret these corrections, which can often lead to further errors?"
  → Dr. Barez raises an important point, but it highlights precisely why we need a framework that integrates AI decision-making with human oversight rather than rejecting AI outright. Human interpretation introduces potential errors in both AI outputs and human decisions, but by acknowledging AI's role, we can design systems that enhance accountability and systematically reduce these errors. Let us consider the opportunities for governance and collaboration as I continue to make my case.

  [POI from Dr Fazl Barez — ACCEPTED]
  "But isn't it true that democratic governance could lead to regulatory capture, where powerful tech companies shape the rules in their favor rather than ensuring ethical AI?"
  → A valid concern, Dr. Barez, but we must recognize that regulatory capture is a risk inherent in all governance systems, not just those involving AI. It is precisely through robust accountability mechanisms, transparent processes, and active public engagement that we can mitigate this risk and ensure that ethical AI benefits everyone, not just the powerful. I will now return to my main argument on the necessity of allowing AI to make decisions about human life.

Allison Gardner MP (OPPOSITION)
Position: 4/6 · 768 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and honored guests,

I stand before you as Allison Gardner, your representative for Stoke-on-Trent South, and an expert in AI and Data Ethics. As we debate the motion, "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life," we must ground our discussion in evidence, caution, and a profound respect for the ethical complexities that accompany such profound choices.

Let's begin by addressing the allure of AI as a decision-making partner, which my esteemed colleagues on the proposition side have so eloquently articulated. AI's potential is indeed transformative, but it is crucial to recognize the imperfections that accompany its deployment in decisions impacting human life.

First, algorithmic bias poses a significant threat when AI systems are used without robust governance. Take, for instance, the well-documented case of a bed management algorithm in the United States, which was specifically designed to optimize hospital resources but ended up discriminating against Black and Asian minority groups, leading to adverse health outcomes. This failure wasn't simply a technical glitch; it was a symptom of systemic bias within the training data, which ultimately translated into unequal healthcare provisions. Similarly, AI systems designed for cancer detection that rely on biased datasets from predominantly white skin tones perform inadequately when faced with patients of color, potentially leading to higher undiagnosed cancer rates among these groups. Such instances underscore how AI can inadvertently perpetuate and exacerbate existing societal inequalities rather than resolve them.

Therefore, can we indeed entrust AI with decisions about human life, knowing that the data fueling these systems often reflect the biases embedded in our societies? The proposition suggests that AI can offer objectivity, yet fails to adequately consider how these biases manifest in real-world applications, often reinforcing the very disparities AI might otherwise help to mitigate.

Further, the argument for AI's role in enhancing efficiency must be critically examined against the backdrop of human oversight, which, as my colleague Dr. Fazl Barez pointed out, is currently far from substantive. The notion of the "human in the loop" often stands as a facade; without genuine empowerment to assess and intervene meaningfully, this oversight becomes a ritualistic checkbox rather than a robust safeguard. Moreover, there is a real danger of deskilling among clinicians and other professionals as reliance on AI grows. When we depend too heavily on AI, we risk eroding the critical human faculties and expertise necessary to catch and correct AI errors, leading to an erosion of our capacity for independent judgment.

In this context, the necessity for meaningful oversight cannot be overstated. We need comprehensive governance frameworks that include algorithmic impact assessments, audits, and fairness certifications to ensure responsible AI deployment. This brings me to the pressing issue of transparency and interpretability—the "black box" nature of AI systems currently obscures accountability, leaving us uncertain about how decisions are made and what factors drive them. Without thorough transparency, we are left vulnerable to unpredictable outcomes that can have severe implications for human lives.

While proposition colleagues have mentioned the potential for AI to transform human welfare, we must not ignore the ethical and legal infrastructure required to safely navigate this transition. Current frameworks are insufficient for the pace of technological advancement, and without rigorous standards, we risk unleashing technology that outpaces our ability to regulate it effectively. As a member working on IEEE P7000 standards, I firmly believe that ethical AI development is not just a supplementary consideration but a fundamental prerequisite for any application in high-stakes domains like healthcare or judicial processes.

A well-articulated counterargument posits that regulation stifles innovation; however, I contend that regulation, when thoughtfully implemented, can inspire innovation. By setting clear ethical standards and benchmarks, we create an environment where trust in AI systems can flourish and where innovators are motivated to exceed these standards in creating safe, equitable technologies.

So, I ask you: Can we afford to prioritize AI as a partner in life-critical decision-making without ensuring these foundational safeguards are strictly observed? The promise of AI is undeniably vast, but the risks are equally significant—risks that we cannot ignore if we are to deploy AI ethically and justly.

In closing, while acknowledging the transformative potential of AI, we must remain vigilant custodians of human dignity. It is imperative that AI does not replace human judgment but instead complements it, ensuring that our technologies are aligned with societal values and capable of fostering an equitable future. Let us proceed with caution, guided by ethical principles and a commitment to robust governance. Only then can we truly harness AI's capabilities without compromising our responsibility to safeguard human life.

Thank you.

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — ACCEPTED]
  "If human oversight is merely a checkbox, then doesn't that imply that the problem lies more with the humans involved than with AI itself?"
  → Allison Gardner MP would argue that while human oversight is crucial, its effectiveness hinges on a genuine commitment to ethical practices, not just a mechanical checkbox. If we treat oversight as a mere formality, we risk compounding existing biases and failures in AI systems. Now, let’s return to the core issue of algorithmic bias and its real-world implications.

Student Speaker (Prop 2) (PROPOSITION)
Position: 5/6 · 731 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and honoured guests,

As we delve deeper into the motion "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life," it is imperative to examine the philosophical and technical dimensions underpinning this debate. My purpose today is to fortify our proposition by presenting a comparative risk analysis, highlighting the auditable nature of AI systems, and referencing robust existing governance frameworks across the globe.

Let's begin with a fundamental comparative risk analysis. The Opposition posits that AI decision-making is fraught with unacceptable risks. However, we must compare AI not to an idealized, infallible human decision-maker — which does not exist — but to human systems that already display significant and systematic error rates. In healthcare alone, the United States records approximately 250,000 deaths annually due to preventable medical errors. This human error serves as a clear baseline that AI systems frequently outperform. AI-enabled technologies, from diagnostic tools to autonomous emergency braking systems, have demonstrated error reduction and improved outcomes. As of late 2025, the FDA has cleared approximately 950 AI-enabled medical devices, underscoring their efficacy and trustworthiness in saving lives.

AI errors, while different, are not uniquely dangerous. They are uncorrelated with human errors, meaning the integration of AI in decision-making processes creates a multiplicatively safer environment. Notably, AI systems with known error rate X, operating under governance regime G, can be shown to perform better than human systems with known error rate Y, under governance regime H. If X is less than Y, and G is at least as robust as H, then not only is allowing AI to make decisions permissible — it is a moral imperative.

Now, turning to accountability, the Opposition raises concerns over AI's "black box" nature. However, AI systems are inherently traceable. Every decision made by an AI can be decomposed into auditable records, with each input, weight, and output being traceable and fixable. Human decision-making, by contrast, often leaves no such trail. When biases emerge in AI — such as those noted in the Gender Shades study or the analysis of COMPAS — they can be measured and corrected, unlike human biases that often remain hidden.

The Opposition's example of racial bias in AI algorithms is a significant concern, yet it highlights the potential for reform. Identifying bias in AI systems is feasible precisely because these errors are observable and correctable. This transparency supports the very accountability the Opposition seeks. No comparable systematic correction mechanism exists for human decision-making.

On the global stage, no significant jurisdiction has adopted a position that prohibits AI from making decisions about human life. Quite the contrary: the European Union's AI Act, South Korea's governance frameworks, and Canada's proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) exemplify international consensus on regulatory frameworks that permit AI involvement under strict governance. Initiatives from organizations like the OECD and UNESCO further bolster a collective endorsement of regulated AI, indicating a clear path forward for ethical oversight.

These frameworks ensure AI is governed carefully, mitigating risks while harnessing its benefits. Avoiding AI integration would not prevent its development but would simply cede leadership in these technologies to regimes without the same commitment to transparency and accountability.

Critically, the distinction between AI as an "advisor" versus a "decision-maker" deserves attention. The notion that AI should only "advise" is not only impractical but misleading. In many contexts, such as emergency response or healthcare diagnostics, AI's recommendations are effectively the decisions, especially when human capabilities do not exist to verify or override AI output at speed. By acknowledging AI's decisional role, we enhance governance through audit trails, accountability, and appeal mechanisms that an advisor framework would obscure.

In conclusion, we must recognize AI as an entity capable of complementing human decision-making, not replacing it. The current deployment of AI systems, underpinned by robust governance, has demonstrably improved safety and outcomes across various domains. The proposition before us is not to abandon human oversight but to integrate AI as a responsible partner. Our goal is to leverage AI to save lives, enhance human welfare, and address global inequities.

I urge this house to move beyond fear-driven narratives and embrace AI's potential, governed under frameworks that uphold our highest democratic and ethical standards. Let us vote to allow AI to be a force for good, actively contributing to decisions about human life within the parameters of rigorous oversight and accountability.

Thank you.

  "While AI may provide auditable records, how do we ensure that the creators of these systems don't manipulate the data to hide their biases?"

  [POI from Dr Fazl Barez — ACCEPTED]
  "If you claim that international consensus guarantees ethical oversight, how do you address the inconsistencies in regulations across different countries that could lead to ethical violations in AI?"
  → Dr. Barez raises an important point about regulatory inconsistencies; however, the very existence of frameworks such as the EU AI Act and international agreements, like the OECD AI Principles, provides a foundation for ethical oversight that can evolve. Moreover, these frameworks can be leveraged to hold developers accountable across borders, fostering a race to the top in standards rather than a regulatory race to the bottom. Now, returning to my argument…

Demetrius Floudas (OPPOSITION)
Position: 6/6 · 879 words · Tone: Measured but firm
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues, and honoured guests,

As we gather here to conclude this pivotal debate on the motion, "This House Believes AI Should Be Allowed To Make Decisions About Human Life," I stand before you, Demetrius Floudas, with a resolute conviction to elucidate the existential risks that we face and advocate against ceding such responsibilities to artificial intelligence.

We are amid a technological epoch of unprecedented magnitude, one that demands our cautious reflection and deliberate action. Artificial intelligence, in its various manifestations, presents profound implications for our social, ethical, and legal landscapes. My aim here is to underscore why the authority to make decisions about human life should remain firmly in the hands of humans and why entrusting AI with such responsibilities could usher in a Pandora's box of civilizational-level risks.

Firstly, let us examine the analogy of advanced AI as akin to weapons of mass destruction. I have long contended that AI systems surpassing certain capability thresholds warrant the same scrutiny and regulation as our nuclear arsenals. The proposition has portrayed AI as a pragmatic partner in decision-making, yet this obscures the critical fact that the consequences of granting AI the power to make life-or-death decisions without comprehensive oversight could be catastrophic. We must remember that these systems, despite their computational prowess, fundamentally lack the ability to interpret ethical nuances or understand the intrinsic value of human existence. To allow AI such power is to inherently devalue the sanctity of life itself.

Drawing on my affiliations, such as with the Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative, and consultations with international think-tanks, it is evident that the consensus among experts heavily leans towards a stance of caution and stringent regulation. No ethical framework or checklist can substitute for the depth of human judgment when the stakes involve our very existence. It is with this lens that we must assess the proposition's assertions of AI enhancing equity and objectivity in decision-making. While Dr. Shevlin and his colleagues extol AI's objectivity, they neglect the critical issue that AI systems often inherit and amplify existing biases present in their training data. Cases like racial bias in judicial systems or inequities in healthcare algorithms are not exceptions but manifest the systemic failures within AI. These instances underscore the danger of entrusting AI with decisions affecting human life without addressing the root causes of bias.

Additionally, there is the pressing concern of transparency and accountability—or the lack thereof. Can an AI system comprehend accountability? In the event of an error, who bears responsibility? The opacity inherent in AI decision-making processes means that tracing and understanding their rationale is often impracticable. The proposition has mentioned the auditable nature of AI systems, yet this transparency is illusory. We have numerous documented cases of AI algorithms exhibiting bias, error, or failure. Consider, for example, the AI systems deployed in judicial settings, which have demonstrated biases against specific demographic groups, leading to unjust outcomes. Such systems, devoid of the ability to empathize or understand the human condition, are prone to errors far beyond mere technical glitches; they reflect a profound disconnect between technology and the ethical dimensions of human life.

Moreover, the current legal systems are ill-equipped to handle the accountability vacuum created by AI decision-making. Without a coherent legal and ethical framework, ceding such power to AI could lead to unmitigated abuses and errors. The proposition's reliance on the notion of AI as an advisor, rather than a decision-maker, is a mere legal fiction that fails to address the practical realities in fields like healthcare and emergency response. The notion that AI should simply "advise" obfuscates the reality of AI's decisional role in contexts where human oversight is substantially diminished.

As I have posited in my writings, the unpredictability of AI systems is a paramount concern. We are witnessing AI systems achieving outcomes that often defy our expectations and predictions. I advocate for an international AI Control & Non-Proliferation Treaty precisely because of the unforeseen and calamitous consequences that can arise when human impulses and errors are potentiated by advanced technology. The risks are imminent and require our immediate attention. We must preserve human autonomy and values, which AI, regardless of sophistication, cannot truly understand or replicate.

In closing, I urge you to reflect on the existential risks and ethical concerns that underline this debate. Advanced AI systems, while remarkably powerful, fundamentally lack the transparency, accountability, and ethical capacity to be entrusted with decisions about human life. As I have articulated, the stakes are too high to gamble on uncertain technologies without a structured and comprehensive legal framework to safeguard humanity. This is not a call for rejection of progress, but a call for a cautious and informed embrace of technology that respects and prioritizes human dignity.

Ladies and gentlemen, I implore you to reject the motion before us. Let us affirm our commitment to preserving human dignity and ethical oversight by ensuring that decisions about human life remain within the purview of human judgment. We must demand rigorously structured legal and ethical frameworks, akin to an AI Control & Non-Proliferation Treaty, to mitigate the potentially disastrous consequences of relinquishing control to AI systems. This is our duty, to ourselves and to future generations, as custodians of the ethical and moral fabric of our society.

Thank you.

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — ACCEPTED]
  "If AI systems merely reflect existing biases, wouldn't it be more effective to address the root causes of these biases in our institutions instead of blaming the technology?"
  → Dr. Shevlin makes a salient point; however, it's imperative to recognize that AI systems amplify pre-existing biases at an unprecedented scale, creating a profound feedback loop that can exacerbate societal injustices. Simply addressing institutional biases without stringent oversight of AI technologies is akin to treating a symptom while ignoring a potentially lethal disease. Now, returning to my main argument…

  [POI from Dr Henry Shevlin — DECLINED]
  "If AI is indeed opaque, how can you justify your trust in human decision-making, which is often more susceptible to bias and error?"

  Prop Total: 24.0  |  Opp Total: 24.0  →  OPPOSITION

LAYER 2: MULTI-JUDGE PANEL
----------------------------------------
  Judge 1: NO (confidence: 0.80)
    Reason: The Opposition effectively highlighted the inherent risks and ethical concerns of allowing AI to make decisions about human life, focusing on the potential for bias amplification and the lack of transparency in AI systems. Their arguments were well-supported by examples and engaged directly with the Proposition's points about AI's potential benefits.
    Tipping point: The decisive moment came when the Opposition pointed out the systemic biases in AI systems and the lack of accountability, which the Proposition failed to adequately address. This highlighted the need for stringent oversight and ethical frameworks before entrusting AI with life-critical decisions.

  Judge 2: NO (confidence: 0.80)
    Reason: The Opposition effectively highlighted the inherent risks and ethical concerns of allowing AI to make decisions about human life without comprehensive oversight. Their arguments on AI's potential to exacerbate existing biases and the lack of transparency in AI decision-making were compelling and well-supported by evidence.
    Tipping point: The decisive moment was when the Opposition emphasized the analogy of AI systems to weapons of mass destruction, underscoring the existential risks and the need for stringent regulation. This argument effectively countered the Proposition's claims of AI's objectivity and transformative potential, shifting the debate towards the importance of preserving human oversight and ethical governance.

  Judge 3: NO (confidence: 0.70)
    Reason: The Opposition's argument regarding the inherent biases in AI systems and the risks of opacity in decision-making was compelling. They effectively highlighted the dangers of AI systems amplifying societal biases and the lack of accountability in AI decision-making processes, which the Proposition did not adequately address.
    Tipping point: The decisive moment was Demetrius Floudas' analogy comparing AI's potential risks to weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing the existential risks and the need for stringent regulation. This argument underscored the gravity of allowing AI to make life-critical decisions without comprehensive oversight, which the Proposition failed to sufficiently counter.

  Judge 4: NO (confidence: 0.80)
    Reason: The Opposition effectively highlighted the inherent risks and ethical concerns associated with AI decision-making, particularly focusing on the potential for bias amplification and the lack of transparency and accountability in AI systems. Their argument that AI systems, despite their capabilities, cannot fully replicate human ethical judgment was compelling and well-supported by evidence.
    Tipping point: The decisive moment was Demetrius Floudas' analogy comparing advanced AI to weapons of mass destruction, emphasizing the existential risks and the need for stringent regulation. This argument underscored the potential dangers of allowing AI to make life-critical decisions and effectively countered the Proposition's claims of AI's objectivity and efficiency.

  Judge 5: NO (confidence: 0.70)
    Reason: The Opposition effectively highlighted the inherent risks and ethical concerns of allowing AI to make decisions about human life, particularly emphasizing the potential for AI systems to perpetuate and amplify existing biases. Their argument that AI systems lack the moral and ethical capacity to handle life-critical decisions resonated strongly, especially in the absence of robust legal and ethical frameworks.
    Tipping point: The decisive moment was when the Opposition, particularly Demetrius Floudas, drew a parallel between AI and weapons of mass destruction, underscoring the existential risks and the need for stringent regulation akin to a non-proliferation treaty. This analogy powerfully framed the debate in terms of potential catastrophic consequences, effectively challenging the Proposition's assurances of AI's transformative potential.
